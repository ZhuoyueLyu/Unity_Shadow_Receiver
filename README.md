# Unity_Shadow_Receiver
This shader makes transparent objects receive shadows.

Not sure who was the original author but I first encountered this shader through the link in the description of this tutorial: https://youtu.be/m4APdFMQIgg?si=NbNHK8gJm7YVSKVz

However, I noticed the shadow only shows in one of the eyes; I searched online and couldn't find a solution. Finally, I saw this doc: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SinglePassInstancing.html

I modified it accordingly, and it works! Just post it here in case somebody else faces the same issue,
